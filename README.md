## Library Management System GUI Application

This is a README file explaining how to run the GUI application for the Library Management System.

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following software installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher.
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 8 or higher.

### Running the Application

To run the GUI application, follow these steps:

1. Open a text editor and create a new file.
2. Copy the entire code provided into the new file.
3. Save the file with the extension `.java`, for example, `LibraryManagementSystem.java`. Make sure the file name matches the name of the public class (`Main` in this case).
4. Open a command prompt or terminal window.
5. Navigate to the directory where you saved the Java file using the `cd` command.
6. Compile the Java file by running the following command:

   ```
   javac LibraryManagementSystem.java
   ```

   This will compile the Java source code and generate bytecode in a file named `LibraryManagementSystem.class`.

7. Run the compiled application by executing the following command:

   ```
   java Main
   ```

   This command will run the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and execute the compiled application.

8. The GUI application window will open, displaying the Library Management System interface.

### Using the Application

Once the GUI application is running, you can perform the following actions:

- Add a book: Click on the "Add Book" button. A dialog box will appear, prompting you to enter the details of the book (author, title, ISBN, publication year, and total copies). Fill in the information and click "OK" to add the book to the library.
- Remove a book: Select a book from the list by clicking on it. Then click on the "Remove Book" button to remove the selected book from the library.
- View book details: Select a book from the list by clicking on it. The details of the selected book will be displayed in the text area.

### Exiting the Application

To exit the application, close the GUI window or terminate the Java process by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the command prompt or terminal where the application is running.

That's it! You now have the instructions to run and use the GUI application for the Library Management System. Enjoy managing your library!
